Assignment 6

	I really enjoyed this assignment! Working with pygame was just very fun for me, plain and simple. I didn’t have any major issues, when it came to coding. The tutorial helped clarify things a lot, in terms of how everything worked, so I usually had a general idea of what I needed to do when it came to implementing any changes. And when I did run into issues a little bit of experimenting and research was enough to get me through.
	I made three total changes to the game. Change one: instead of having only one laser sound effect for when the player shot at enemies, I made it so they had multiple different laser sounds that switched at random (I think four total). Change two: when enemies got too close, I made it so the background switched to a bright red ‘DANGER’ background, and then switched back to the normal background if the player either destroyed the enemies that got too close, or lost. Change three: I made it so that, when the player moved, the ship angled either left or right slightly, to make the movement seem more realistic.
	If I could do anything different, I would probably add an alarm sound for when enemies got too close. I did try to, but I kept running into issues—the alarm sound would play back too fast, or wouldn’t stop playing once it started—so eventually I just threw in the towel. I would also try to make enemy movements more realistic, like I did with the player’s movements.
